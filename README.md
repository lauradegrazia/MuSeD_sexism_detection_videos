# MuSeD: A Multimodal Spanish Dataset for Sexism Detection

MuSeD is a new Multimodal Spanish dataset for Sexism Detection consisting of â‰ˆ 11 hours of videos extracted from TikTok and BitChute. Content is considered sexist in four main cases:
* Stereotype: It attributes a set of properties that supposedly differentiate men and women, based on stereotypical beliefs.
* Inequality: It asserts that gender inequalities no longer exist.
* Discrimination: It discriminates against the LGBTQ+ community.
* Objectification: It portrays women as physical objects, often hypersexualizing their bodies.
The following figure illustrates a sexist video that includes a gender stereotype:
