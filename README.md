# MuSeD: A Multimodal Spanish Dataset for Sexism Detection in Social Media Videos

In this study, (1) we 11 introduce MuSeD, a new Multimodal Spanish dataset for Sexism Detection consisting of â‰ˆ 11 hours of videos extracted from TikTok and BitChute; (2)
we propose an innovative annotation framework for labeling sexist and non-sexist content, with annotations conducted at different levels (text, speech, and video), to examine the contribution of textual and multimodal information to identifying sexist and non-sexist content; and (3) we evaluate a range of Large Language Models (LLMs) and multimodal LLMs on the task of sexism detection.
